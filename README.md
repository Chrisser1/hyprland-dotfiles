# hyprland-dotfiles
To use this repository, you need to have Hyprland installed and configured on your system. This repository contains configuration files for Hyprland, Waybar, and other related tools.
I use stow to manage my dotfiles, so you can use stow to install the configurations in this repository. For example, to install the Hyprland configuration, you can run:

```bash
stow hyprland
```
